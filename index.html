      My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I found out he
      was going to die. That it was going to happen soon. That it was real. Then
      I thought about a lot of stuff. Things I hadn't thought about for a long
      time. I guess I kind of took him for granted or something. I mean, our
      parents are just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you to
      clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or try new things
      to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one day. And make you get up
      early on the weekend to have "family time" and all that other stuff that
      used to drive me crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different
      since Dad got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the near
      future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.

      Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that
      question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-
      sible. One day he won't be here to ask. Now I feel lucky when I hear his
      car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-
      ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.
